## üìù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.

When filing a bug report, include:
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux distribution, or Windows version
- **Shell**: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell version
- **Pretty-ls version**: Run `pls --version`
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** if applicable

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:
- Check existing issues and discussions first
- Clearly describe the feature and its benefits
- Consider how it fits with the project's goals
- Provide examples of how it would work

### Contributing Code

#### Types of Contributions

- **Bug fixes**: Fix existing issues
- **New features**: Add functionality that enhances the tool
- **Performance improvements**: Make the tool faster or more efficient
- **Documentation**: Improve README, comments, or add examples
- **Platform support**: Extend compatibility to new platforms/shells

#### Development Guidelines

1. **Follow existing code style**:
   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for shell scripts)
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Follow shell scripting best practices

2. **Cross-platform compatibility**:
   - Test on multiple platforms when possible
   - Use portable commands and syntax
   - Handle platform differences gracefully

3. **Error handling**:
   - Check for command failures
   - Provide helpful error messages
   - Fail gracefully when possible

4. **Performance**:
   - Keep the tool fast and lightweight
   - Avoid unnecessary external dependencies
   - Test with large directories

#### Code Style Guidelines

**Shell Scripts (Bash/Zsh):**
```bash
# Use readonly for constants
readonly CONSTANT_VALUE="value"

# Use local variables in functions
function my_function() {
    local variable="value"
    # function body
}

# Check command success
if command -v git >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Git is available"
fi

# Use proper error handling
if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then
    echo "Error: File not found" >&2
    return 1
fi
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Use approved verbs for functions
function Get-Something {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$Path
    )
    
    # Use proper error handling
    try {
        # code here
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Error: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        return
    }
}

# Use consistent formatting
$Variable = "Value"
```

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Test basic functionality**:
   ```bash
   # Test in current directory
   ./scripts/pls.sh
   
   # Test with different directories
   ./scripts/pls.sh /tmp
   ./scripts/pls.sh ~/Documents
   
   # Test help and version
   ./scripts/pls.sh --help
   ./scripts/pls.sh --version
   ```

2. **Test edge cases**:
   - Empty directories
   - Directories with many files
   - Files with special characters in names
   - Very long filenames
   - Symbolic links (Unix/Linux)

3. **Test on your platform**:
   - Verify colors display correctly
   - Check emoji rendering
   - Test with different terminal emulators

4. **Test installation** (if you modified installers):
   ```bash
   # Test the installer
   ./install/install-macos.sh  # or appropriate installer
   
   # Verify installation works
   pls --version
   ```

### Submitting Changes

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

2. **Write good commit messages**:
   - Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Keep the first line under 50 characters
   - Add a detailed description if needed

3. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Use a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List what you tested
